                    By added display: flex property to an element, we are making the element a flex container. When display: flex property is added to an element, we are really defining display: block flex. The outer display type of our flex container is block and it acts like a block level element in normal flow. The inner display type is flex, so items directly inside our container will participate in flex layout.

                Closure means that an inner function always has access to the variables and parameters of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned. To use a closure, simply define a function inside another function and expose it.Closure is used to hide the implementation details in JavaScript. In other words, it can be useful to create private variables or functions.

                    Arrow function in ES6 removes some of the syntax along with refining how to handle “this”. Arrow functions do not have their own “this”. They are not well suited for defining object methods. Arrow functions are not hoisted that means they must be defined before they are used. Using const is safer than using var because a function expression is always a constant value.

                JavaScript executes all operations on a single thread, but with the help of call stack, API stack, event queue and event loop, it gives the illusion of multi-threading. The event loop handles the process of checking whether the call stack empty or not. If the call stack is empty, new functions are added from the event queue to call stack. If the call stack is not empty, then the function call is processed. Event loop plays a major role behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming.

                Both promises and async/await are built on promises. Only the promise chain is asynchronous in promises whereas the entire wrapper function is asynchronous in async/ await. Synchronous work can be handled in the same callback that means multiple promises can use Promise.call() in case of promises whereas synchronous work needs to be moved out of the callback that means multiple promises can be handled with simple variables. Error handling is similar in both promises and async/ await.

                Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. They provide an alternative approach for callbacks by reducing the callback and writing the cleaner code. A promise is an object that may produce a single value sometime in the future with a resolved value or a reason that it is not resolved (for example, network error).

                When we need to pass down the data, to components that lives in many levels of nested components, to avoid passing the same data through so many levels down, we can use context API so that every component can have access to it without passing
                down data through multiple levels.

                        <li>Redux is a state management system for JavaScript applications based on Flux design pattern. It is tiny in size and has no dependencies.</li>
                        <li>Redux follows Single source of truth, state is read-only and changes to state are made with pure functions. These principles make state becomes more predictable.</li>

                        <li>actions are plain JavaScript objects that hold type of action and the optional payload, reducers are pure functions to compute new state based on action that got triggered, store, containers, and components.</li>

                    The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases: <br/>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Mounting:</b> The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from constructor(), getDerivedStateFromProps(), render(), and componentDidMount() lifecycle methods.</li>
                        <li><b>Updating:</b> In this phase, the component get updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from setState() or forceUpdate(). This phase covers getDerivedStateFromProps(), shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() and componentDidUpdate() methods.</li>
                        <li><b>Unmounting:</b> In this last phase, the component is not needed and get unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Functional Component: <br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In functional components, with the help of useEffect() hook we can use side effects
                        of the lifecycle methods like componentDidMount(), componentDIdUpdate(),
                        componentWillUnmount().</li>
                        <li>useEffect takes a callback method and an optional state param.</li>
                        <li>useEffect runs after initial render and each update.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Lifecycle: <br />
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>getDerivedStateFromProps:</b> Invoked right before calling render() and is invoked
                        on every render. This exists for rare use cases where you need derived state. Worth
                        reading if you need derived state.</li>
                        <li><b>componentDidMount:</b> Executed after first rendering and here all API calls, DOM or
                        state updates, and set up event listeners should occur.</li>
                        <li><b>shouldComponentUpdate:</b> Determines if the component will be updated or not. By
                        default, it returns true. If you are sure that the component doesn't need to render after
                        state or props are updated, you can return false. It is a great place to improve
                        performance as it allows to prevent a re-render if component receives new prop.</li>
                        <li><b>getSnapshotBeforeUpdate:</b> Executed right before rendered output is committed to the
                        DOM. Any value returned by this will be passed into componentDidUpdate(). This is
                        useful to capture information from the DOM i.e. scroll position.</li>
                        <li><b>componentDidUpdate:</b> Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or
                        state changes. This will not fire if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.</li>
                        <li><b>componentWillUnmount:</b> It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests or
                        remove all event listeners associated with the component.</li>
